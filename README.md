# Hi There!

## I'm a Computer Science student at São Judas Tadeu University in São Paulo, Brazil. Currently, I'm working as a junior full-stack developer. 

### I'm passionate about exploring various programming languages and applying my knowledge to real-world projects. In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively contribute to personal and university projects, constantly expanding my skills in the dynamic field of software development.



### I embarked on my academic journey by delving into Java and SQL during my university studies. Subsequently, I extended my skill set in the professional realm, where I actively contributed to front-end development. 
### Leveraging technologies such as JavaScript and TypeScript within the Angular framework, I had the opportunity to create impactful tools and enhance my proficiency in web development.
